Week 4 blog post for Software Engineering. 

# What did you do this past week?

This past week, I began working on the second project for the class. In the project, we were given some training and probe data on Netflix ratings and asked to design a system that could predict customer ratings on movies they haven't seen before, within an accuracy defined by a RMSE value of 1.00 or less. 

In the course, we had a guest speaker who spoke to us about software engineering in the workforce and Bloomberg as a company. I think it was very interesting to gain insight on the different technologies that companies are using. We also discussed in depth how different ways to calculate RMSE using Python.

# What's in your way?

So far, nothing is really in my way. We will have to see if any challenges arise as I continue and finish up the project in the next week. The article that is posted on the Netflix page has been very helpful in providing tips to calculate RMSE.

# What will you do next week?

As I mentioned above, next week I will be finishing and submitting the Netflix project. 

# My experience in the course

I think it was valuable to have a guest speaker in the course, as it's always valuable to learn from those with first-hand experience. The project also seems interesting so far. 

# Tip of the week

The [Programmer Humor](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor) subreddit can be pretty funny at times and is generally interesting to read.
