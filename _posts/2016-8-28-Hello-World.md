title: Hello, World! (Week 1)
---

Welcome to my first blog post!

# What did you do this past week?

During this week, I was exposed to C++ for the first time. I took this class as a way for me to solidify my skills in both C++ and Java, and it's been interesting learning about the ways in which they compare and contrast.

# What's in your way?

From Professor Downing's approach to teaching this class, it seems that most of the students come from a Java background. However, my skills in Java are still quite undeveloped, as I come from a web and iOS development background. And while Objective-C (for iOS) is also an object oriented language based on C (and unrelatedly, NeXT), I'm sure there are plenty of differences to learn about.

# What will you do next week?

Start working on the projects, familiarizing myself with different development technologies, and hopefully learn about the intricate details of object-oriented languages!

# My expectations/experience in the course

The class is taught in a format that I quite enjoy; it seems much more interactive and hands-on than traditional college courses, which are mostly lecture-based. However, while the presentation seems engaging, one of my concerns is regarding the actual content for the course. Based on the classes this week, it seems that much of the focus of the course seems, as Professor Downing stated, to prepare us to be employable once we graduate. As he admits, much of this is related to learning about the different tools in the software development process - from version control, to testing, deployment, etc. And while these tools are most definitely very useful (in fact, I use some of them regularly in my own projects), I hope that there will be a heavier focus on the actual concepts of object-orientated programming. 

# Tip of the week

In my limited exposure to Java development, one of the projects I worked on was developing an IDE using the Java Eclipse API. In this project, I needed to override some of the native libraries in the API to incorporate some different behaviors. Here's the tip: you can use the Java *Instrumentation* library to override the class loader and replace specific library classes with your own, using something called a JavaAgent.
